If you publish artifacts with OSS Sonatype (central Maven repo) there are download statistics available for the artifacts you publish from your account.

Note that it usually updates a few days after each month.

    Go to https://oss.sonatype.org
    Login with the account you publish artifacts with.
    Click "Central Statistics Repositories".

Reference: Here's a blog post describing how to access the feature.
